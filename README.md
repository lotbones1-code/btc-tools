# BTC Tools Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard that visualizes Bitcoin market signals generated by the `quant_core` utilities. Use it to monitor live price action, key indicators, and export the latest data snapshots.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the dashboard**

   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard/app.py
   ```

The dashboard pulls data from Kraken via `ccxt` and refreshes automatically based on the interval you choose in the sidebar controls.

## Promoting your referral link

You can surface a prominent referral banner and sidebar call-to-action inside the dashboard by setting a few environment variables before you launch Streamlit. At minimum, provide the destination URL:

```bash
export REFERRAL_LINK="https://example.com/your-referral"
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Additional optional variables let you tailor the marketing copy to match your offer:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REFERRAL_HEADLINE` | Main headline displayed in the banner. | `"Unlock bonuses with our referral link"` |
| `REFERRAL_SUBHEAD` | Supporting sentence describing the offer. | `"Join with our exclusive invite to trade smarter with real-time signals."` |
| `REFERRAL_BENEFIT` | Bolded benefit line (e.g., the bonus amount). | Hidden when unset |
| `REFERRAL_CTA` | Text for the primary call-to-action button/link. | `"Get the referral bonus"` |
| `REFERRAL_DISCLAIMER` | Small-print disclaimer text beneath the button. | Hidden when unset |

When the variables are present, the app renders a gradient card at the top of the page and a matching button in the sidebar so visitors see your invite link right away.

## Exporting data

Select your preferred timeframe, then use the “Download CSV” button beneath the table to export the latest indicator readings for further analysis.

## Development notes

The dashboard relies on helper functions defined in `quant_core.py` to fetch, enrich, and classify Bitcoin market data. Feel free to extend the layout or indicators to fit your trading workflow.
